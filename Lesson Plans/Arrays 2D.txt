1. Create an int 1D array
1b. populate with for loop

2. Create an int 2D array
2b. populate with nested for loops

3. Create an int 2D array (delayed initialization)
3.b populate with same nested loops, but now we need to create new sub-arrays

4. Create a 2D ReallySimpleClass array (delayed)
4b. populate with nested loops, but now we need new objects

5. Create a 3D ReallySimpleClass array (delayed)
5b. populate with nested loops

6. Create two 1D arrays that reference the same set of ReallySimpleClass objects.

7. Create a 2D array and populate with the two 1D arrays.
