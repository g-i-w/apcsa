- review binary search in pre-lab
- talk about the compareTo String method
- talk about comparing to index before (mid-1) and index (mid)

- situation: duplicates that are longer than the search String
  - compareTo will cause the search to float up to the first index naturally
- situation: duplicates that are exact matches with the search String
  - need to check for index before

- Use indexOf to find each of the matches after the first
